# Analyzing 120 years of Olympic history: from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016

In this project, we will analyze and explore 120 years of Olympic Games data. The dataset is divided into two files. The first file `athlete_events.csv` contains 271,116 rows and 15 columns: ID, Name, Sex, Age,	Height,	Weight,	Team,	NOC,	Games, Year,	Season,	City,	Sport, Event, and	Medal. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). It contains both information about summer and winter games. The second file `noc_regions.csv` contains 230 rows and 3 columns: NOC, region, and notes. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and the original analysis can be found in: [120 years of Olympic history: athletes and results](https://www.kaggle.com/code/heesoo37/olympic-history-data-a-thorough-analysis/report).

The analysis will have four steps:
- Data preparation and cleaning: We will be removing outliers and filling up the Nan values.
- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization: We will be exploring the dataset and its composition.
- Asking and Answering Questions: We will ask some interesting questions about the dataset and extract some inferences.
- Inferences and Conclusion: We will summarize the key inferences obtained from the previous steps.

Additionally, in the last section *References and Future Work*, we'll be discussing future analyses and work with this dataset.
